Particle Size Reduction – Experimental Analysis of Surface Area and Energy Requirements
This project presents an experimental study on the particle size reduction of brick samples through controlled manual crushing. The aim was to measure the effect of crushing on particle size and specific surface area, estimate the energy requirement, and validate the results using well-established size reduction theories such as Rittinger’s, Kick’s, and Bond’s laws.
